# Mohameds-Igoo-Quiz
My submission for the quiz assignment.

I started off by putting too much information in my html. But after sometime, I realized that the html will not matter since I'm using java, which would bring about new prompts. So I scavenged the internet to help with my javascript and finnicky css. I chose to go with darker colors, not necessarily a "dark theme" because I was afraid of making some mistake.

I forgot how to make sure the leader board stays up, I'll work on that and update accordingly.
